Iterations
==========

Iteration 1
-----------

A single Civilization is instantiated at year zero with a random
number of people, and an initial fertility and mortality rate. Over
the course of 100 years, the population increases/decreases by those
rates, and outputs the population for that year to the screen.

Iteration 2
-----------

A random famine event causes a large, single year spike in deaths.
Such an event, and the resultant death count, is output to the screen.

Iteration 3
-----------

A ruler character is created at instantiation (just a number). They
start at 21 years old and age until they die of old age (randomly
determined by actuarial table).

Iteration 4
-----------

The ruler character can get married and have children.

Iteration 5
-----------

Characters are given first names using a rudimentary name creator.

Iteration 6
-----------

Characters should have family names. When two characters get married,
it's random which one gets put into the others family, unless one of
the characters has no family name (indicating they are commoners.)
Children inherit the family name of their parents.

Iteration 7
-----------

A character becoming the ruler of a civ is an event.

Iteration 8
-----------

Rulers are suceeded by their first living child.

Iteration 9
-----------

Children are most likely to be named based on their parents or
grandparents.

Iteration 10
------------

Better succession: English rules, walk the tree. There's still a bug
in this, needs improvement.

Iteration 11
------------

- marriages between elite families
- random number of elite houses created

When a civilization is created, 3-5 elite houses are created. To
create a house, a founder member is generated between 50 and 100
years before the civs founding, and the family tree run forward to the
civ founding year. Each house has a head, which starts with the
founder and is inherited on death. One of the houses becomes the
ruling family of the civ, and the current head of the house becomes
the ruler. When a ruler dies and there are no suitable candidates from
the house to succeed them, a random other house is selected to be the
ruling house, and their current head becomes the ruler.

The civ founding message looks like this:

> The civilization [name] emerged in year [year]. It numbered [pop]
> people. The civilization was ruled by house [ruling house name]. The
> houses of [other house names] were also prominent at this time.

When elites get married they prefer to marry someone in another elite
family, only marrying a commoner if there are no available candidates.

In short
--------

- Family trees for characters, marriage, children
- Elite families
- Religions and priestly casts
- Multiple civilizations
- Written histories
- Emergant elites from military
- Characters have attributes: intelligence, physical, charisma, military, tall, short, obese, skinny, righteous, loyal
- Name generation should be done based on standard phoenetic symbols, not on latin letters. Then, translate them to latin letters (or another literation system)
- Longer term: Given names should be tracked at the civ level, and change in popularity over time.

Small Changes, refactors
------------------------

- Different birth / death rates for males and females.
- Adjust birth / death rates to be more like medieval europe
- From above, check that population doesn't explode too badly
