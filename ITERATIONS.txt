Iterations
==========

Iteration 1
-----------

A single Civilization is instantiated at year zero with a random
number of people, and an initial fertility and mortality rate. Over
the course of 100 years, the population increases/decreases by those
rates, and outputs the population for that year to the screen.

Iteration 2
-----------

A random famine event causes a large, single year spike in deaths.
Such an event, and the resultant death count, is output to the screen.

Iteration 3
-----------

A ruler character is created at instantiation (just a number). They
start at 21 years old and age until they die of old age (randomly
determined by actuarial table).

In short
--------

- Family trees for characters, marriage, children
- Succession for rulers
- Founding of new settlement
