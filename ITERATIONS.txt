Iterations
==========

Iteration 1
-----------

A single Civilization is instantiated at year zero with a random
number of people, and an initial fertility and mortality rate. Over
the course of 100 years, the population increases/decreases by those
rates, and outputs the population for that year to the screen.

Iteration 2
-----------

A random famine event causes a large, single year spike in deaths.
Such an event, and the resultant death count, is output to the screen.

Iteration 3
-----------

A ruler character is created at instantiation (just a number). They
start at 21 years old and age until they die of old age (randomly
determined by actuarial table).

Iteration 4
-----------

The ruler character can get married and have children.

Iteration 5
-----------

Characters are given first names using a rudimentary name creator.

Iteration 6
-----------

Characters should have family names. When two characters get married,
it's random which one gets put into the others family, unless one of
the characters has no family name (indicating they are commoners.)
Children inherit the family name of their parents.

In short
--------

- Event for character becoming the ruler of a civ
- Family trees for characters, marriage, children
- Succession for rulers
- Elite families
- Religions and priestly casts
- Multiple civilizations

Small Changes
-------------

- Different birth / death rates for males and females.
