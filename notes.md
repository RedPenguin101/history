Notes

Becoming a bit too character centric. Focus more on what the
civilization is doing.

Civs can demand tribute from other civs.

A historian character can write a history. What is included and
excluded will depend on what they know, who they know, and their
political leanings. Resulting books can end up in libraries, which can
be referenced by future historians (or lost).

During a military campaign, a common soldier became a hero-general,
propelling themselves into the elite.

Gods
----

I think the gods will be a sort of risk/reward mechanism. Gods are
real, and _created_ by a civilization and the civ has a score which
represents how religious they are. A high religion score will increase
the power of the gods, meaning the benefits you get from dedicating
resources to them is higher. But so is the expectation of the god, and
the severity of the punishment they can exact if those expectations
are not met.

For example, a civilization creates a god of the fields. They start
off only slightly religious, and dedicate a small amount of resources
to the god, getting modest increases to their crop yields. Over time,
they become more religious, so must dedicate more resources to the
god. But they also become more properous, so they can easily meet
those requirements. One year, a war goes badly, and a settlement isn't
able to produce nearly enough to meet the high requirements. The god
punishes them with a severe drought, which inhibits their ability to
make the next dedication. Religiousity _increases_ in the face of
these challenges, driving demand up as the ability to meet it
decreases - a vicious cycle. The settlement quickly collapses.

ChatGPT on early civ development
--------------------------------

The emergence of early agricultural settlements marked a significant
shift in human history, transitioning from nomadic lifestyles to
permanent communities. This change primarily took place around 10,000
BCE in regions such as the Fertile Crescent, where favorable climatic
conditions and rich soils enabled the cultivation of staple crops like
wheat and barley. As these early settlers began to cultivate their
fields, they experienced an abundance of food, leading to the concept
of **surplus** production.

### Organization of Surpluses and Taxation

Surpluses from agricultural production laid the groundwork for more
complex societal structures. With ample food supplies, populations
grew, necessitating new forms of organization. As communities
expanded, leaders emerged to manage resources, allocate labor, and
ensure equitable distribution of food. This often involved the
establishment of a form of **taxation**, where a portion of the
agricultural surplus would be collected by local leaders or councils.
In many cases, these leaders were initially elders or religious
figures, but as societies became larger and more complex, their roles
evolved into official governance.

Taxation was also instrumental in funding communal projects such as
irrigation systems and defensive structures. The accumulation and
management of surplus required organized and strategic planning, which
eventually led to the consolidation of power in the hands of local
kings. These kings, often supported by a class of nobles or priests,
claimed authority based on divine right or lineage, establishing
themselves as pivotal figures in the societal hierarchy.

### Emergence of Militaries for Protection

As agricultural settlements grew, so did the need for protection
against external threats. The surplus of resources made these
communities attractive targets for raids from neighboring groups.
Consequently, a structured **military organization** began to develop
within these early settlements. While initially consisting of local
militia made up of farmers defending their homes, this evolved into
more organized forces under the leadership of kings. They recruited
warriors, provided weapons, and organized defense strategies, which
included building fortifications around settlements.

Military prowess not only provided security but also established local
kings as significant power players, capable of expanding their
territories through conquest. With military engagements, the kinship
bonds that initially defined social organization began to intertwine
with territorial claims, resulting in structured states defined by
borders, governance, and militaristic capabilities.

In summary, the development of early agricultural settlements
transformed human society from small, nomadic groups into complex,
organized communities. Through the management of agricultural
surpluses, the establishment of taxation, and the emergence of
militaries for protection, these settlements laid the foundations for
future civilizations.

## Necessity for New Forms of Organization in Larger Populations

As populations within early agricultural settlements increased,
several critical factors emerged that necessitated the development of
new organizational structures. These factors included resource
management, social complexity, conflict resolution, and economic
interactions, all of which required more nuanced governance and
coordination.

### Resource Management

With a larger population, the demand for resources—such as food,
water, and land—intensified. Managing these resources effectively
became crucial to prevent scarcity and ensure the survival of the
community. Leadership was required to oversee the allocation of
farmland, the organization of labor for planting and harvesting, and
the storage and distribution of surplus. This shift often led to the
establishment of specialized roles, moving away from a primarily
egalitarian structure to one where certain individuals or groups
assumed authority over resource management.

### Social Complexity

In larger populations, social relationships became more intricate. The
diversity of roles—farmers, craftsmen, traders, and religious
leaders—created varying interests and needs. With this complexity,
there was a growing necessity for social hierarchies and governance
systems. Communities required clearer social structures to facilitate
cooperation, manage conflicts, and create a sense of identity and
belonging among distinct groups. This often led to the establishment
of laws, norms, and even rudimentary bureaucracies.

### Conflict Resolution

As communities expanded, so did potential conflicts, both within and
between groups. Disputes over land, resources, and social status
became more common, necessitating formal systems for conflict
resolution. Leadership structures evolved to address these issues,
creating judicial systems or councils that could mediate disputes
fairly. This capacity for governance helped to maintain social order,
allowing communities to function cohesively despite growing tensions.

### Economic Interactions

Larger populations also encouraged trade and economic interactions
beyond the community. As surplus production increased, early
settlements began to establish trade routes with neighboring groups,
requiring more formalized economic structures. Leaders were often
tasked with overseeing trade agreements, ensuring fair exchange
practices, and even imposing taxes or tariffs, thereby reinforcing
their authority and further necessitating structured governance.

In essence, as the population size of early agricultural settlements
increased, the complexity of managing resources, relationships,
conflicts, and economic activities necessitated new forms of
organization. These organizational structures laid the groundwork for
the development of more sophisticated societies, complete with
governance and social hierarchies.
