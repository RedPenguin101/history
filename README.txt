History Generation
==================

I would like to write a history generator in the vein of dwarf
fortress (obviously much less complex). I'd like to be able to 'read'
the history like a history book.

- 10 civilizations 'start' at year 0 with a random number of people.
- Years are simulated one-by-one
- For each civilization, many events are generated every year
- Each civilization has a bunch of stats which define it - arable
  land etc.
- Religion sizes, official religion
- Track army size
- Track individual elites - royals, landowners, religious heads

Events:

- Assassinations
- Coups
- Religion founded
- Droughts/Famines
- Marriages
- Peasant revolt
-
