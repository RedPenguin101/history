History Generation
==================

A program which generates a world history, from the dawn of
agriculture to the rise and fall of empires.

Around year zero, the people of this world begin to discover that, in
places where the soil is especially fertile, the production of certain
crops will in many years yield more food than is required for their
basic needs. Groups of people begin to live permanently in these
fertile places, creating their fields there, and creating a communal
surplus for use in the times of drought.

Our history begins by following several of these settlements, and
their ruling families, as they propagate around the continent, each
the seedling of a Civilisation. Over time, they grow or shrink with
the harvests. An administrative class emerges to manage the collection
and distribution of food and justice.

As the settlements spread, they make contact with each other. They
trade the resources and outputs of their respective industries, form
alliances through the marriages of their prominent families, and
occasionally raid and slaughter each other. The civilisations, through
emigration, marriage and conquest, encompass many settlements in the
region, becoming kingdoms.

Long Term Ambitions
-------------------

- cities with (high) mortality rates due to disease, but sustained by immigration
- natural resources: arable land, forests, iron, copper, tin.
- industries produce goods. Can be household industries, state industries or capitalistic industries
- farming produces wool as well as food
- trade between settlements
- Armies and Generals
